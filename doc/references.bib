	% abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Axisymmetric oscillations of fluid in a rapidly rotating whole sphere immersed in a magnetic field can be supported by the elastic tension of the magnetic field lines. This special class of Alfvén waves is largely geostrophic (invariant along the rotation axis) and describes a set of normal modes that has been extensively studied in the ideal, lossless case, a limit in which regular solutions do not exist when the background magnetic field is axisymmetric. We study the geophysically relevant limit with parameters such that magnetic diffusion plays a realistic role appropriate to the Earth’s core, by choosing a Lundquist number {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} appropriately. We demonstrate for the first time the existence of normal modes in the presence of an axisymmetric background field, and obtain eigenfrequencies and decay rates that lead us to deduce quality factors {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} for these modes for two simple background fields of dipole and quadrupole parity. Two scaling behaviours of {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} are seen depending on the background field and normal modes’ frequency, one scaling as {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}msup{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}/{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/msup{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} and another as {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} , so that likely {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}\&gt;{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}10{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} in the core of the Earth.

	abstract = {An approximation is developed that lends itself to accurate description of the physics of fluid motions and motional induction on short time scales (e.g. decades), appropriate for planetary cores and in the geophysically relevant limit of very rapid rotation. Adopting a representation of the flow to be columnar (horizontal motions are invariant along the rotation axis), our characterization of the equations leads to the approximation we call plesio-geostrophy, which arises from dedicated forms of integration along the rotation axis of the equations of motion and of motional induction. Neglecting magnetic diffusion, our self-consistent equations collapse all three-dimensional quantities into two-dimensional scalars in an exact manner. For the isothermal magnetic case, a series of fifteen partial differential equations is developed that fully characterizes the evolution of the system. In the case of no forcing and absent viscous damping, we solve for the normal modes of the system, called inertial modes. A comparison with a subset of the known three-dimensional modes that are of the least complexity along the rotation axis shows that the approximation accurately captures the eigenfunctions and associated eigenfrequencies.},
