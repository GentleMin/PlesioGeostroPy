	% abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Axisymmetric oscillations of fluid in a rapidly rotating whole sphere immersed in a magnetic field can be supported by the elastic tension of the magnetic field lines. This special class of Alfvén waves is largely geostrophic (invariant along the rotation axis) and describes a set of normal modes that has been extensively studied in the ideal, lossless case, a limit in which regular solutions do not exist when the background magnetic field is axisymmetric. We study the geophysically relevant limit with parameters such that magnetic diffusion plays a realistic role appropriate to the Earth’s core, by choosing a Lundquist number {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} appropriately. We demonstrate for the first time the existence of normal modes in the presence of an axisymmetric background field, and obtain eigenfrequencies and decay rates that lead us to deduce quality factors {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} for these modes for two simple background fields of dipole and quadrupole parity. Two scaling behaviours of {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} are seen depending on the background field and normal modes’ frequency, one scaling as {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}msup{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}/{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/msup{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} and another as {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} , so that likely {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}\&gt;{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}10{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} in the core of the Earth.

	abstract = {An approximation is developed that lends itself to accurate description of the physics of fluid motions and motional induction on short time scales (e.g. decades), appropriate for planetary cores and in the geophysically relevant limit of very rapid rotation. Adopting a representation of the flow to be columnar (horizontal motions are invariant along the rotation axis), our characterization of the equations leads to the approximation we call plesio-geostrophy, which arises from dedicated forms of integration along the rotation axis of the equations of motion and of motional induction. Neglecting magnetic diffusion, our self-consistent equations collapse all three-dimensional quantities into two-dimensional scalars in an exact manner. For the isothermal magnetic case, a series of fifteen partial differential equations is developed that fully characterizes the evolution of the system. In the case of no forcing and absent viscous damping, we solve for the normal modes of the system, called inertial modes. A comparison with a subset of the known three-dimensional modes that are of the least complexity along the rotation axis shows that the approximation accurately captures the eigenfunctions and associated eigenfrequencies.},

A related set of orthogonal functions is given here which represent vector quantities, such as mapping distortion or wavefront gradient. These functions are generated from gradients of Zernike polynomials, made orthonormal using the Gram-Schmidt technique. This set provides a complete basis for representing vector fields that can be defined as a gradient of some scalar function. It is then efficient to transform from the coefficients of the vector functions to the scalar Zernike polynomials that represent the function whose gradient was fit. These new vector functions have immediate application for fitting data from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor or for fitting mapping distortion for optical testing. A subsequent paper gives an additional set of vector functions consisting only of rotational terms with zero divergence. The two sets together provide a complete basis that can represent all vector distributions in a circular domain.},

	abstract = {The Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) describes the decomposition of a flow field into its divergence-free and curl-free components. Many researchers in various communities like weather modeling, oceanology, geophysics, and computer graphics are interested in understanding the properties of flow representing physical phenomena such as incompressibility and vorticity. The HHD has proven to be an important tool in the analysis of fluids, making it one of the fundamental theorems in fluid dynamics. The recent advances in the area of flow analysis have led to the application of the HHD in a number of research communities such as flow visualization, topological analysis, imaging, and robotics. However, because the initial body of work, primarily in the physics communities, research on the topic has become fragmented with different communities working largely in isolation often repeating and sometimes contradicting each others results. Additionally, different nomenclature has evolved which further obscures the fundamental connections between fields making the transfer of knowledge difficult. This survey attempts to address these problems by collecting a comprehensive list of relevant references and examining them using a common terminology. A particular focus is the discussion of boundary conditions when computing the HHD. The goal is to promote further research in the field by creating a common repository of techniques to compute the HHD as well as a large collection of example applications in a broad range of areas.},
