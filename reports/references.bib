	% abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Axisymmetric oscillations of fluid in a rapidly rotating whole sphere immersed in a magnetic field can be supported by the elastic tension of the magnetic field lines. This special class of Alfvén waves is largely geostrophic (invariant along the rotation axis) and describes a set of normal modes that has been extensively studied in the ideal, lossless case, a limit in which regular solutions do not exist when the background magnetic field is axisymmetric. We study the geophysically relevant limit with parameters such that magnetic diffusion plays a realistic role appropriate to the Earth’s core, by choosing a Lundquist number {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}L{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}u{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} appropriately. We demonstrate for the first time the existence of normal modes in the presence of an axisymmetric background field, and obtain eigenfrequencies and decay rates that lead us to deduce quality factors {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} for these modes for two simple background fields of dipole and quadrupole parity.

	abstract = {An approximation is developed that lends itself to accurate description of the physics of fluid motions and motional induction on short time scales (e.g. decades), appropriate for planetary cores and in the geophysically relevant limit of very rapid rotation. Adopting a representation of the flow to be columnar (horizontal motions are invariant along the rotation axis), our characterization of the equations leads to the approximation we call plesio-geostrophy, which arises from dedicated forms of integration along the rotation axis of the equations of motion and of motional induction. Neglecting magnetic diffusion, our self-consistent equations collapse all three-dimensional quantities into two-dimensional scalars in an exact manner. For the isothermal magnetic case, a series of fifteen partial differential equations is developed that fully characterizes the evolution of the system. In the case of no forcing and absent viscous damping, we solve for the normal modes of the system, called inertial modes. A comparison with a subset of the known three-dimensional modes that are of the least complexity along the rotation axis shows that the approximation accurately captures the eigenfunctions and associated eigenfrequencies.},

This set provides a complete basis for representing vector fields that can be defined as a gradient of some scalar function. It is then efficient to transform from the coefficients of the vector functions to the scalar Zernike polynomials that represent the function whose gradient was fit. These new vector functions have immediate application for fitting data from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor or for fitting mapping distortion for optical testing. A subsequent paper gives an additional set of vector functions consisting only of rotational terms with zero divergence. The two sets together provide a complete basis that can represent all vector distributions in a circular domain.},

	abstract = {The Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) describes the decomposition of a flow field into its divergence-free and curl-free components. Many researchers in various communities like weather modeling, oceanology, geophysics, and computer graphics are interested in understanding the properties of flow representing physical phenomena such as incompressibility and vorticity. The HHD has proven to be an important tool in the analysis of fluids, making it one of the fundamental theorems in fluid dynamics. The recent advances in the area of flow analysis have led to the application of the HHD in a number of research communities such as flow visualization, topological analysis, imaging, and robotics. However, because the initial body of work, primarily in the physics communities, research on the topic has become fragmented with different communities working largely in isolation often repeating and sometimes contradicting each others results. Additionally, different nomenclature has evolved which further obscures the fundamental connections between fields making the transfer of knowledge difficult. This survey attempts to address these problems by collecting a comprehensive list of relevant references and examining them using a common terminology. A particular focus is the discussion of boundary conditions when computing the HHD. The goal is to promote further research in the field by creating a common repository of techniques to compute the HHD as well as a large collection of example applications in a broad range of areas.},

	abstract = {Dissipation in numerical ocean models has two purposes: to simulate processes in which the friction is physically relevant and to prevent numerical instability by suppressing accumulation of energy in the smallest resolved scales. This study shows that even for the latter case the form of the friction term should be chosen in a physically consistent way. Violation of fundamental physical principles reduces the fidelity of the numerical solution, even if the friction is small. Several forms of the lateral friction, commonly used in numerical ocean models, are discussed in the context of shallow-water equations with nonuniform layer thickness. It is shown that in a numerical model tuned for the minimal dissipation, the improper form of the friction term creates finite artificial vorticity sources that do not vanish with increased resolution, even if the viscous coefficient is reduced consistently with resolution. An alternative numerical implementation of the no-slip boundary conditions for an arbitrary coast line is considered. It was found that the quality of the numerical solution may be considerably improved by discretization of the viscous stress tensor in such a way that the numerical boundary scheme approximates not only the stress tensor to a certain order of accuracy but also simulates the truncation error of the numerical scheme used in the interior of the domain. This ensures error cancellation during subsequent use of the elements of the tensor in the discrete version of the momentum equations, allowing for approximation of them without decrease in the order of accuracy near the boundary.},

These differ on a curved surface, for example a sphere. The three terms are related and their properties discussed, in particular energy and angular momentum conservation. In the case of the shallow water equations again three forms of dissipation are considered, the last of which involves the divergence of a stress tensor. Their properties are discussed, including energy conservation and whether the rotating bucket solution of the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation is reproduced. A derivation of the viscous term is also given based on shallow water equations as a truncation of the Navier–Stokes equation, with forces on a column determined by integration over the vertical. For both incompressible ﬂow on a surface and for the shallow water equations, it is argued that a viscous term based on a symmetric stress tensor should be used as this leads to correct treatment of angular momentum.},

We redefine the water surface level at the cell interface by using the minimum difference between the bottom level and the original water surface level. The reconstructed water surface level is used to define the intermediate bottom level and the intermediate water height at the cell interface. We propose an explicit-implicit method to address the friction source term. The new second-order SR scheme together with the explicit-implicit method can preserve a special steady-state solution of the system and can maintain the positivity of the water depth. We also extend the new scheme to two-dimensional shallow water flows. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the new scheme, we use several classical numerical experiments for the shallow water flows over a complex bottom topography.},

We used computational simulations in a shallow water model to determine the relationship between the Manning coefficient and the parameters of small-scale perturbations of a bottom in a long channel.

	abstract = {The first part of this two-part paper presents a general theory of dissipative dynamical systems. The mathematical model used is a state space model and dissipativeness is defined in terms of an inequality involving the storage function and the supply function. It is shown that the storage function satisfies an a priori inequality: it is bounded from below by the available storage and from above by the required supply. The available storage is the amount of internal storage which may be recovered from the system and the required supply is the amount of supply which has to be delivered to the system in order to transfer it from the state of minimum storage to a given state. These functions are themselves possible storage functions, i.e., they satisfy the dissipation inequality. Moreover, since the class of possible storage functions forms a convex set, there is thus a continuum of possible storage functions ranging from its lower bound, the available storage, to its upper bound, the required supply. The paper then considers interconnected systems. It is shown that dissipative systems which are interconnected via a neutral interconnection constraint define a new dissipative dynamical system and that the sum of the storage functions of the individual subsystems is a storage function for the interconnected system. The stability of dissipative systems is then investigated and it is shown that a point in the state space where the storage function attains a local minimum defines a stable equilibrium and that the storage function is a Lyapunov function for this equilibrium. These results are then applied to several examples. These concepts and results will be applied to linear dynamical systems with quadratic supply rates in the second part of this paper.},

	abstract = {We compare seven different strategies for computing spectrally-accurate approximations or differential equation solutions in a disk. Separation of variables for the Laplace operator yields an analytic solution as a Fourier–Bessel series, but this usually converges at an algebraic (sub-spectral) rate. The cylindrical Robert functions converge geometrically but are horribly ill-conditioned. The Zernike and Logan–Shepp polynomials span the same space, that of Cartesian polynomials of a given total degree, but the former allows partial factorization whereas the latter basis facilitates an efficient algorithm for solving the Poisson equation. The Zernike polynomials were independently rediscovered several times as the product of one-sided Jacobi polynomials in radius with a Fourier series in θ. Generically, the Zernike basis requires only half as many degrees of freedom to represent a complicated function on the disk as does a Chebyshev–Fourier basis, but the latter has the great advantage of being summed and interpolated entirely by the Fast Fourier Transform instead of the slower matrix multiplication transforms needed in radius by the Zernike basis. Conformally mapping a square to the disk and employing a bivariate Chebyshev expansion on the square is spectrally accurate, but clustering of grid points near the four singularities of the mapping makes this method less efficient than the rest, meritorious only as a quick-and-dirty way to adapt a solver-for-the-square to the disk. Radial basis functions can match the best other spectral methods in accuracy, but require slow non-tensor interpolation and summation methods. There is no single “best” basis for the disk, but we have laid out the merits and flaws of each spectral option.},

	abstract = {We present a new family of algorithms for incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical geometry. A model problem of turbulent flow calculation in an infinite circular pipe \{(r, ϕ, z): 0 ≤ r ≤ R, 0 ≤ ϕ {\textless} 2π, {\textbar}z{\textbar} {\textless} ∞\} is considered and used for accuracy, stability, and efficiency estimations. Algorithms are based on Galerkin trigonometric approximation for uniform variables ϕ, z, on pseudospectral polynomial approximation in the r -direction (with different sets of collocation nodes) and on implicit and predictor-corrector time advancement schemes. In all cases high (infinite order) spatial accuracy is retained despite the presence of coordinate singularity at r = 0. To achieve this we exploit the behaviour of analytic functions of variables r, ϕ, z in the vicinity of r = 0. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of four Navier-Stokes algorithms. In method A a new splitting technique is developed which makes use of a second-order predictor-corrector scheme and nontraditional fractional step procedure. Stability and efficiency characteristics of this scheme exceed that of the usually used mixed Adams-Bashforth/Crank-Nicolson time advancement. To minimize errors due to splitting, algorithm B is suggested that has no fractional steps. In this method pressure values are eliminated from discretized Navier-Stokes equations by means of equivalent matrix operations. Although conventional Chebyshev collocation nodes rl = R cos(πl/2Q), l = 0, 1, ..., Q, are used in both methods, the discrete boundary conditions at r = 0—consistent with analytic behaviour of solutions for small r—are fully accessible for the first time. In addition, approximations developed prevent the appearance of various pathological (with, e.g., spurious, parasitic modes, etc.) discretizations of Navier-Stokes operators. In algorithm C we propose a new set of collocation nodes rl = (1 - xl )R/2, l = 0, 1, ..., Q, where xl ϵ (-1, 1), l = 1, 2, ..., Q - 1, are the zeros of Jacobi polynomial P(2,1)0-1(x), xD = -1, x0 = 1. It is demonstrated that pseudospectral polynomial approximation with this set of nodes possesses the discrete analogue to the energy conservation law of the original Navier-Stokes initial boundary value problem. The latter is of special significance for the algorithm's nonlinear stability. In method D new dependent variables are introduced that completely consider the form of the analytic pressure and velocity components at small r. We show that the discrete Navier-Stokes equations admit in this case an efficient solution procedure. Finally, we present a technique that can be used for exhaustive a priori estimates of the algorithm's accuracy and stability characteristics in the linear approach.},

A multi-domain technique with patching interfaces yields significant improvements in the conditioning of the algebraic problems arising from the discretization procedure and allows for an enhanced near wall resolution of wall bounded shear flows. The elliptic kernel enjoys the efficiency of an analytic expansion of the harmonic extension. The method is tested by computing the formation of Taylor vortices in a rotating Couette flow for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric configurations.

	abstract = {Numerical methods for solving the flow equations in cylindrical or spherical coordinates should be able to capture the behavior of the exact solution near the regions where the particular form of the governing equations is singular. In this work we focus on the treatment of these numerical singularities for finite-difference methods by reinterpreting the regularity conditions developed in the context of pseudo-spectral methods. A generally applicable numerical method for treating the singularities present at the polar axis, when nonaxisymmetric flows are solved in cylindrical coordinates using highly accurate finite-difference schemes (e.g., Pade schemes) on nonstaggered grids, is presented. Governing equations for the flow at the polar axis are derived using series expansions near r=0. The only information needed to calculate the coefficients in these equations are the values of the flow variables and their radial derivatives at the previous iteration (or time) level. These derivatives, which are multivalued at the polar axis, are calculated without dropping the accuracy of the numerical method using a mapping of the flow domain from (0, R)*(0, 2π) to (−R, R)*(0, π), where R is the radius of the computational domain. This allows the radial derivatives to be evaluated using high-order differencing schemes (e.g., compact schemes) at points located on the polar axis. The accuracy of the method is checked by comparison with the theoretical solution corresponding to a circular compressible forced jet in the regime of linear growth. The proposed technique is illustrated by results from simulations of laminar-forced jets and turbulent compressible jets using large eddy simulation (LES) methods. In terms of the general robustness of the numerical method and smoothness of the solution close to the polar axis, the present results compare very favorably to similar calculations in which the equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates at the polar a xis, or in which the singularity is removed by employing a staggered mesh in the radial direction without a mesh point at r=0, following the method proposed recently by Mohseni and Colonius [1]. Extension of the method described here for incompressible flows or for any other set of equations that is solved on a nonstaggered mesh in cylindrical or spherical coordinates with finite-difference schemes of various levels of accuracy is immediate.},

The basis functions are orthogonal with respect to the natural inner product for a circular domain. It is demonstrated how the Laplace operator and its inverse can be expressed exactly in terms of these basis functions. It is also shown how the advection term can be evaluated without aliasing, making use of a transform grid with equidistant angular values and Gaussian radial values. It is shown that without forcing and friction the model conserves absolute enstrophy and circulation and, if the planetary vorticity is circularly symmetric, also angular momentum. The model does not conserve energy. However, the degree of conservation of energy rapidly increases with increasing resolution.

The Chebyshev-collocation method applied in the radial and axial directions, and the Fourier–Galerkin approximation used in the azimuthal direction lead to a sequence of two-dimensional Helmholtz and Poisson equations for every azimuthal coefficient that are solved by a diagonalization technique. Radial expansions are considered in the diameter of the cell in order to avoid clustering about the axis, and the number of points are selected to ensure that r=0 is not a collocation point. A minimal number of regularity conditions are imposed implicitly at the origin by forcing the proper parity of the Fourier expansions in the radial direction. The method has been tested on analytical solutions and compared with other reliable three-dimensional results. The improvements introduced in the treatment of the spatial discretization reduce significantly the difficulty of implementation of the code, and facilitate the use of high resolutions.

	abstract = {A primitive-variable formulation for simulation of time-dependent incompressible flows in cylindrical coordinates is developed. Spectral elements are used to discretise the meridional semi-plane, coupled with Fourier expansions in azimuth. Unlike previous formulations where special distributions of nodal points have been used in the radial direction, the current work adopts standard Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre nodal-based expansions in both the radial and axial directions. Using a Galerkin projection of the symmetrised cylindrical Navier–Stokes equations, all geometric singularities are removed as a consequence of either the Fourier-mode dependence of axial boundary conditions or the shape of the weight function applied in the Galerkin projection. This observation implies that in a numerical implementation, geometrically singular terms can be naively treated by explicitly zeroing their contributions on the axis in integral expressions without recourse to special treatments such as l'Hopital's rule. Exponential convergence of the method both in the meridional semi-plane and in azimuth is demonstrated through application to a three-dimensional analytical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations in which flow crosses the axis.},

In particular, the computational complexities of the Chebyshev--Galerkin method in a disk and the Chebyshev--Legendre--Galerkin method in a disk or a cylinder are quasi-optimal (optimal up to a logarithmic term). As an indication of efficiency, the CPU time for the Poisson solver on a disk by our Chebyshev--Galerkin method is only about 70\% of the corresponding finite-difference code in FISHPACK.},

	abstract = {Spectral methods are an efficient way to solve partial differential equations on domains possessing certain symmetries. The utility of a method depends strongly on the choice of spectral basis. In this paper we describe a set of bases built out of Jacobi polynomials, and associated operators for solving scalar, vector, and tensor partial differential equations in polar coordinates on a unit disk. By construction, the bases satisfy regularity conditions at r=0 for any tensorial field. The coordinate singularity in a disk is a prototypical case for many coordinate singularities. The work presented here extends to other geometries. The operators represent covariant derivatives, multiplication by azimuthally symmetric functions, and the tensorial relationship between fields. These arise naturally from relations between classical orthogonal polynomials, and form a Heisenberg algebra. Other past work uses more specific polynomial bases for solving equations in polar coordinates. The main innovation in this paper is to use a larger set of possible bases to achieve maximum bandedness of linear operations. We provide a series of applications of the methods, illustrating their ease-of-use and accuracy.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0022112083000518},
	abstract = {An analysis is given of a secondary instability that obtains in a wide class of wall-bounded parallel shear flows, including plane Poiseuille flow, plane Couette flow, flat-plate boundary layers, and pipe Poiseuille flow. In these flows it is shown that two-dimensional finite-amplitude waves are (exponentially) unstable to infinitesimal three-dimensional disturbances. This secondary instability seems to be the prototype of transitional instability in these flows in that it has the characteristic (convective) timescales observed in the typical transitions. In the case of plane Poiseuille flow, two-dimensional nonlinear equilibria and quasi-equilibria exist, and the stability of the secondary flow is determined by a three-dimensional linear eigenvalue calculation. In flows without equilibria (e.g. pipe flow), a time-dependent stability analysis is performed by direct spectral numerical calculation of the incompressible three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations.The energetics and vorticity dynamics of the instability are discussed. It is shown that the two-dimensional wave mediates the transfer of energy from the mean flow to the three-dimensional perturbation but does not directly provide energy to the disturbance. The instability is of an inviscid character as it persists to high Reynolds numbers and grows on convective timescales. Maximum vorticity (inflexion-point) arguments predict some features of the instability like phase-locking of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional waves, but they do not explain its essential three-dimensionality. The inviscid vorticity dynamics of the instability shows that vortext-stretching and tilting effects are both required to explain the persistent exponential growth. The instability is not centrifugal in nature.The three-dimensional instability requires that a threshold two-dimensional amplitude be achieved (about 1\% of the centreline velocity in plane Poiseuille flow): the growth rates are relatively insensitive to amplitude for moderate two-dimensional amplitudes. With moderate two-dimensional amplitudes, the critical Reynolds numbers for substantial three-dimensional growth are about 1000 in plane Poiseuille and Couette flows and several thousand in pipe Poiseuille flow. The asymptotic (as R approaches infinity) growth rate in plane Poiseuille flow is approximately 0·15h/U0, where h is the half-channel width and U0 is the centreline velocity.It is possible to make some progress identifying experimental features of transitional spot structure with aspects of the nonlinear two-dimensional/linear three-dimensional instability. The principal excitation of the eigenfunction of the three-dimensional (growing) disturbance is localized within a given periodicity length (in both the stream and cross-stream directions) near the vorticity maxima of the two-dimensional flow; its planwise structure corresponds to that of observed streaks in early transitional spots; its vortical structure resembles that of a streamwise vortex lifting off the wall. As the three-dimensional disturbance grows to finite amplitude, the flows become chaotic with statistical structure similar to that observed experimentally in moderate-Reynolds-number turbulent shear flows.},
